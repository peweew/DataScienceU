## Summary:

Titanic tragedy is one of the most famous ship accident in human history. In this report, we visualize the survival chance for a passenger on ship. We use the javascript library -- d3 and dimple to demonstrate the correlation between the passenger's attributes and the chance of survival.

## Design:

In our data visualization of titanic dataset, we use a few technique to demonstrate the correlation between passengers' attributes and the survival chance. The techniques we are using as follow:

1. We need to show the readers the number of survival persons on each attributes. So we choose to use the bar chart to denote the number of servivals and non servivals. 

2. In each attribute, we need to show the readers the ratio between the survival and non survivals. Therefore, the reader can understand how much chance a person with special attribute would survive.

3. Since there are four attributes: PClass, Sex, Age, and Embark, there are too many information if we show all diagrams in one pages. So we design user interactive button. User can review each chart by click the button. We also allow users to interact with the chart. When user mouse move over the chart, it will show the information of each bar in detail.

4. In order for reader to understand the chart better, we add text as assist instruction.

5. In order to show the real data of each bar, we add the number that the bar stand for on top of each bar. 


## Feedback:

Jason: The bar chart is very interesting but I take a few minites to understand it meaning. Some instruction or text would be good.



Susan: The chart needed to interactively click button in the beginning. If there are some automatic animation to play each chart, it would be more interesting.

Arash: The data of the bar chart is unclear. I can only find the number of bar by moving mouse over. 

 

## A readerâ€™s summary

The four bar charts give me some information about the total number of each categroies, the survival number and death number. It also show me the comparision of the survived person and dead person. Each survival and death bar are marked by different color. I can read how many person dead in each category, compare survival and death ratio, and get some hint on how the survival rate are affected by a person's attributes, for example, Sex.
